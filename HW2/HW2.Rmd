## Q1. PhysioNet credential

At this moment, you should already get credentialed on the PhysioNet. Please include a screenshot of your `Data Use Agreement for the MIMIC-IV (v0.4)`.

***Solution: My `Data Use Agreement for the MIMIC-IV (v1.4)` has already been uploaded.***

## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

***The `fread` used the least time and the `read.csv` used the longest time.***

```{r,eval=FALSE}
system.time(read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/core/admissions.csv.gz")))
```
```{r,eval=FALSE}
system.time(read.csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/core/admissions.csv.gz")))
```
```{r,eval=FALSE}
system.time(fread("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/core/admissions.csv.gz"))
```

## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

***Solutions***

```{r}
icustays_tble<- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/icustays.csv.gz"))%>%
  print(width=Inf)
```
1.unique `stay_id`
```{r}
icustays_tble %>%
  distinct(stay_id)%>%
  nrow ()
```
2.unique`subject_id`
```{r}
icustays_tble %>%
  distinct(subject_id)%>%
  nrow ()
```

3.length of icu stay
```{r}
icustays_tble %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = log(los)))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),fill ="orange",colour="yellow") +
  xlab("length of stay(days)")+
  ylab("Density of total ICU stay")
```

4.first icu unit
```{r}
icustays_tble %>%
  count(first_careunit)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = icustays_tble) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = first_careunit,fill = first_careunit))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5,hjust=1))
```

5.last icu unit
```{r}
icustays_tble %>%
  count(last_careunit)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = icustays_tble) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = last_careunit, fill = last_careunit))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5,hjust=1))
```


## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 



Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 

```{r}
admission<- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/core/admissions.csv.gz"))%>%
  print(width=Inf)
```
***summarize of the variables related to admission dates***
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(.,subject_id,.keep_all=T)%>%
  mutate(month = month(admittime),
         year = year(admittime),
         weekdays = weekdays(admittime),
         days=day(admittime),
         hours=hour(admittime),
         dyear=year(deathtime)) -> admission.date 
```
```{r}
admission.date%>%
  count(days)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = year, fill ="orange",colour="yellow"))+
  xlab("Admission year")+
  ylab("Total count")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = month, fill ="orange",colour="yellow"))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = weekdays, fill = weekdays))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = days, fill ="orange",colour="yellow"))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hours, fill ="orange",colour="yellow"))
```
***We could find that most admissions occured in the evening(18-24),especially for 0'clock. The admissions uniformly distributed among the days,months and years.***

***number of death in each year***
using the `deathtime`
```{r}
filter(admission.date,!is.na(dyear))%>%
  nrow ()
```

using the `hospital_expire_flag`
```{r}
filter(admission.date,hospital_expire_flag==1)%>%
  count(hospital_expire_flag)
```
***We could find that there're 4 missing data in the death time, but we could see more details about the more details from `deathtime`,so we choose this variable to do the analysis.***

***admission & discharge location: We could find that admissions occurred mostly in emergency room and the discharge occured mostly in health care faculty.***
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = admission_location, fill = admission_location))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = discharge_location, fill = discharge_location))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```


***admission_type: We could find that the mostly occurred admission type is 'EW EMER'.***
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = admission_type, fill = admission_type))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

***insurance: We could find that the mostly occurred insurance is 'other' and medicare occurred more than medicaid.***
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = insurance, fill = insurance))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

***language: We could find that the mostly occurred language is English.***
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = language, fill = language))
```

***marital_status: We could find that the mostly occurred marital status is married.***
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = marital_status, fill = marital_status))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

***ethnicity: We could find that the mostly occurred ethnicity is White.***
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = ethnicity, fill = ethnicity))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

***The number of admissions per patient is 524520/257366=2.038***
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(hadm_id)%>%
  nrow ()
```

```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(subject_id)%>%
  nrow ()
```

***death*** 
```{r}
ggplot(data = admission.date) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = dyear, fill ="orange",colour="yellow"))
```


## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)
```{r}
patient<- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/core/patients.csv.gz"))%>%
  print(width=Inf)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = patient) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = gender,fill = gender))
```
```{r}
patient%>%
 count(gender)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = patient) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = anchor_age,fill = anchor_age))
```
```{r}
patient%>%
 count(anchor_age)
```
```{r}
patient%>%
 filter(anchor_age!=0 )%>%
  select(anchor_age)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=anchor_age))+
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(y=..density..),fill='orange')+
  geom_density(alpha=0.6)+
  theme_classic()
```
***Solutions***:From the bar chart,we can figure out that the most patiens has the anchor_age of 0,and there's no anchor_age between 0-18.The ANCHOR_AGE is the age of the patient in the given ANCHOR_YEAR/ANCHOR_YEAR_SHIFTED.The '0' might refers to the missing data, so we delete the '0' data and analyzed for the rest.

## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, hematocrit, white blood cell count, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and lactate. Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

First take a look at the data.
```{r}
if(!file.exists("labevents_icustays.csv.gz")) {
  system.time(labevents_tab <-
    fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"),
          select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid",
                     "charttime", "valuenum"),nThread = 4))
  labevents_tab %>%
    semi_join(icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
    fwrite("labevents_icustays.csv.gz",nThread = 4)
}
system.time(labevents_tab <- fread("labevents_icustays.csv.gz",nThread=4))
labevents_tab %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```
```{r}
dlabitems_tble<- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz"))
```
```{r}
labitems <- c("creatinine", "potassium", "sodium", "chloride",
             "bicarbonate", "hematocrit", "white blood cell",
             "glucose", "magnesium", "calcium", "lactate")
itemids <- rep(0, length(labitems))
i <- 1
for (labitem in labitems) {
  print(str_interp("search for ${labitem}"))
  itemid_list <- dlabitems_tble %>%
    filter(str_detect(label, regex(labitem, ignore_case = T))) %>%
    .$itemid
  itemid <- labevents_tab %>%
    filter(itemid %in% itemid_list) %>%
    count(itemid) %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    slice(1) %>%
    .$itemid
  itemids[i] <- itemid
  i <- i + 1
}
```

```{r}
labitem_itemid <- tibble(itemid = itemids, labitem = labitems) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```
```{r}
labevents_tab<-labevents_tab %>%
  as_tibble()%>%
  #keep the items in itemid
  filter(itemid %in% labitem_itemid$itemid)%>%
  mutate(charttime=ymd_hms(charttime))%>%
  print(width=Inf)
```

## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

#Gain the itemids
```{r}
dchartitems_tble<-read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/d_items.csv.gz"))
```
```{r}
chartitems<-c("heart rate","blood pressure","blood pressure",
              "temperature", "SpO2",  "respiratory rate" )
for(chartitem in chartitems){
  print(str_interp("search for ${chartitem}"))
  dchartitems_tble %>%
    filter(str_detect(label,regex(chartitem,ignore_case=T)))%>%
    print(width=Inf)
}
```
#This way took forever to read the file.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists("chartevents_icu.csv.gz")) {
  system.time(chartevents_tab <-
    fread(str_c(mimic_path,"/icu/chartevents.csv.gz"),
          select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid",
                     "charttime", "valuenum"),nThread = 4))
  chartevents_tab %>%
    semi_join(icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
    fwrite("chartevents_icu.csv.gz",nThread = 4)
}
system.time(chartevents_tab <- fread("chartevents_icu.csv.gz",nThread=4))
chartevents_tab %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```
Gain a smaller one data set.
```{r}
system.time(chartevents_tble<- fread("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv-derived-data/chartevents_filtered_itemid.csv.gz",
                                     header=FALSE,
                                     col.names=c("subject_id",
                                                 "hadm_id",
                                                 "stay_id",
                                                 "charttime",
                                                 "itemid",
                                                 "valuenum"),
                                     nThread=4)%>%
as_tibble()%>%
mutate_at(c("subject_id","hadm_id","stay_id","itemid"),as.numeric)%>%
mutate(charttime=ymd_hms(charttime))%>%
print(width=Inf))
```

## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission  


```{r}
icustays_uniq_tble <- icustays_tble %>%
  # take first icu stay of each unique patient 
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  filter(rank(intime)==1)%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  #slice_min(intime) %>%
  # merge admissions table
  left_join(admission,by=c("subject_id","hadm_id"))%>%
  # merge
  left_join(patient, by="subject_id")%>%
  # only keep adults
  mutate(age_at_adm =year(admittime)-anchor_year+anchor_age)%>%
  filter(age_at_adm>=18) %>%
  print(width=Inf) 
```
Merge lab results
```{r}
icustays_tble_lab<- labevents_tab%>%
  semi_join(icustays_uniq_tble,by=c("subject_id","hadm_id"))%>%
  #plus intime column
  left_join(select(icustays_uniq_tble,subject_id,hadm_id,intime),
            by=c("subject_id","hadm_id"))%>%
  #take the lab items after icu intime
  filter(charttime>=intime)%>%
  #group by itemid
  group_by(subject_id,itemid)%>%
  #only keep the first charttime
  arrange(charttime, .by_group=TRUE)%>%
  slice_head(n=1)%>%
  #don't need charttime intime
  select(-charttime,-intime)%>%
  spread(key=itemid,value=valuenum)%>%
  #merge with icustays_uniq_tble
  right_join(icustays_uniq_tble,by=c("subject_id","hadm_id"))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  #name all the labitems
  rename_at(vars(as.character(labitem_itemid$itemid)),
            ~labitem_itemid$labitem)%>%
  print(width=Inf)
```
chartevents
```{r}
chartevents_uniq_tble <- chartevents_tble %>%
  select(-stay_id)%>%
  print(width=Inf) 
```
```{r}
icustays_lab_chart <-chartevents_uniq_tble%>%
  semi_join(icustays_tble_lab,by=c("subject_id","hadm_id"))%>%
  #plus intime column
  left_join(select(icustays_tble_lab,subject_id,hadm_id,intime),

  right_join(icustays_tble_lab,by=c("subject_id","hadm_id"))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  print(width=Inf)
```
###we could find that since there's no data for the patient to test the Forehead SpO2 Sensor in Place(229862) after entering the icus, so we didn't have the data of SpO2 for icu patients.
```{r}
icustays_lab_chart$Dieday<-
  as.numeric(icustays_lab_chart$deathtime-icustays_lab_chart$admittime)
icustays_lab_chart$Diein30<-(0<icustays_lab_chart$Dieday&
                               icustays_lab_chart$Dieday<43200)
icustays_final<- icustays_lab_chart%>%
  select(-Dieday)%>%
  rename(Heartrate = `220045`,abps = `220050`,abpm = `220052`,nbps= `220179`, 
         nbpm= `220181`,respirationrate =`220210`,temperature_f= `223761`) %>%
  print(width=Inf)
```
